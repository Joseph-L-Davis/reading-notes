# HTML & CSS

## Introduction
  1) Web servers can be anywhere in the world
  2) HTML and CSS are sent from said servers to be displayed on our devices
  3) The newest versions of these languages are HTML5 and CSS3

  ## Chapter 1
  ### HTML tags are used to differentiate between areas of a webpage (i.e. h1 for a large heading and p for smaller
  ### text in paragraph form, usually.) 'View source' or 'Inspect' can be used to peak under the hood of a website to 
  ### see its HTML and CSS makeup.

  ## Chapter 8
  ### Class and ID attributes can be added to HTML tags to separate and identify individual (or sometimes groups of)
  ### HTML tags. Certain tags like div and span can be used to group other elements together with slightly different
  ## effect (inline vs block). We are also introduced to the meta element, used to store information about the web page
  ## such as keywords and description for search engines to utilize.

  ## Chapter 17
  ### New elements introduced in HTML5 like article, aside, header and footer are introduced to more easily identify 
  ### elements rather than using a div with an ID attribute. 
  ## Using display: block with the new elements will help older browsers know how to render them properly.

  ## Chapter 18
  ### When designing a website you want it to be attractive, easy to navigate and intuitive. Know that your site doesn't
  ### need to be for everyone, narrow down a target audience.
  ### What motivates your audience to visit your site and what are they gaining from it?


  # Javascript & Jquery

  ## Introduction
  ### This book explains how to make a website interactive using Javascript. The layout of the book is explained the same
  ### as in the HTML & CSS book by the same author. Accessing content, modifying content and reacting to events such as
  ### a mouse click are some ways Javascript can make pages more interactive.

  ## Chapter 1
  ### Scripts are described using recipes or manuals as examples of more "human" scripts and explains how computers think
  ### programmatically, carefully following individual instructions.
  ### Objects, properties and methods are lightly introduced with real world examples such as a hotel and its occupancy,
  ### a car and its make and model.
  ### Importing a separate Javascript file into the HTML using a script tag tells the web browser to load the Javascript
  ### file, implementing its functionality.
